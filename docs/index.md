# Question Answer Manager


## Description

Questionnaires and configurations have all some form of key - value sheets serving all kinds of purposes. This library tries to help setting up a question/answer sheet and store it in the managers environment. Then a user application can retrieve a sheet to display and store the results.


# Versions of involved software

* Programs and libraries are tested against the latest version of **Raku** on **Rakudo** en **Moarvm**.

* Gtk library used **Gtk 3.24**. The versioning of GTK+ is a bit different in that there is also a 3.90 and up. This is only meant as a prelude to version 4. So do not use those versions for the Raku packages.


# Installation

Simple and strait forward.

`zef install QAManager`
